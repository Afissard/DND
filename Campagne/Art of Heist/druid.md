## Capacities 
**Darkvision**. Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**Fey Ancestry**. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.

**Trance**. Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is "trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

**Mask of the Wild**. You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.

**Druidic.** You know Druidic, the secret language of Druids. While learning this ancient tongue, you also unlocked the magic of speaking to animals; you always have the Speak with Animals spell prepared.
You can use Druidic to leave hidden messages. You and others who know Druidic automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check but can’t decipher it without magic.

**Wild Shape (2).** The power of nature allows you to assume the form of an animal. As a Bonus Action, you shape-shift into a Beast form that you have learned for this feature (see “Known Forms” below). You stay in that form for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level or until you use Wild Shape again, have the Incapacitated condition, or die. You can also leave the form early as a Bonus Action.
- **Number of Uses**. You can use Wild Shape twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
- **Known Forms**. You know four Beast forms for this feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks that have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1/4 and that lack a Fly Speed. The [Rat](https://www.aidedd.org/monster/rat), [Riding Horse](https://www.aidedd.org/monster/riding-horse), [Spider](https://www.aidedd.org/monster/spider), and [Wolf](https://www.aidedd.org/monster/wolf) are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your known forms with another eligible form. When you reach certain Druid levels, your number of known forms and the maximum Challenge Rating for those forms increases, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. In addition, starting at level 8, you can adopt a form that has a Fly Speed. When choosing known forms, you may look in the [_Monster Manual_](https://www.aidedd.org/monster/) or elsewhere for eligible Beasts if the Dungeon Master permits you to do so.
 
|Druid Level|Known Forms|Max CR|Fly Speed|
|---|---|---|---|
|2|4|1/4|No|
|4|6|1/2|No|
|8|8|1|Yes|

**Rules While Shape-Shifted**. While in a form, you retain your personality, memories, and ability to speak, and the following rules apply:
- **Temporary Hit Points**. When you assume a Wild Shape form, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to your Druid level.
- **Game Statistics**. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the Beast's stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features; languages; and feats. You also retain your skill and saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving throw modifier in the Beast'stat block is higher than yours, use the one in the stat block.
- **No Spellcasting**. You can’t cast spells, but shape-shifting doesn’t break your Concentration or otherwise interfere with a spell you’ve already cast.
- **Objects**. Your ability to handle objects is determined by the form’s limbs rather than your own. In addition, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it's practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment based on the creature’s size and shape. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with the form. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect while you're in that form.

**Wild Companion.** You can summon a nature spirit that assumes an animal form to aid you. As a Magic action, you can expend a spell slot or a use of Wild Shape to cast the _[Find Familiar](https://www.aidedd.org/spell/find-familiar)_ spell without material components. When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is a Fey, and it disappears when you finish a Long Rest.

**Circle Forms.** You have learned ancient techniques that allow you to channel lunar magic when you assume a Wild Shape form, granting you the following benefits:
- **Challenge Rating**. The maximum Challenge Rating for the form equals your Druid level divided by 3 (round down).
- **Armor Class**. Your AC equals 13 plus your Wisdom modifier or the Beast AC (whichever one is higher), until you leave the form.
- **Temporary Hit Points**. You gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to three times your Druid level.

**Circle of the Moon Spells.** Your connection to this circle ensures that you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Druid level specified in the Circle of the Moon Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared. In addition, you can cast the spells from this feature while you are in Wild Shape form.

| Druid Level | Prepared Spells         |

| 3           | *Cure Wounds, Moonbeam* |
| 5           | _Conjure Animals_       |
| 7           | _Fount of Moonlight_    |
| 9           | _Mass Cure Wounds_      |
