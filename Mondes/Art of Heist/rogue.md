## Capacities 
**Darkvision**. Thanks to your infernal heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**Infernal Legacy**. You know the [_thaumaturgy_](https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=thaumaturgy) cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the [_hellish rebuke_](https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=hellish-rebuke) spell as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the [_darkness_](https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=darkness) spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

**Expertise.** You gain Expertise in two of your skill proficiencies of your choice. Sleight of Hand and Stealth are recommended if you have proficiency in them.

**Sneak Attack.** You know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack roll if you have Advantage on the roll and the attack uses a Finesse or a Ranged weapon. The extra damage’s type is the same as the weapon’s type.
You don’t need Advantage on the attack roll if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the target, the ally doesn’t have the Incapacitated condition, and you don’t have Disadvantage on the attack roll.
The extra damage increases as you gain Rogue levels, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue Features table.

**Thieves' Cant.** You picked up various languages in the communities where you plied your roguish talents. You know Thieves’ Cant and one other language of your choice, which you choose from the languages tables.

**Cunning Action.** Your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. On your turn, you can take one of the following actions as a Bonus Action: Dash, Disengage, or Hide.

**Steady Aim.** As a Bonus Action, you give yourself Advantage on your next attack roll on the current turn. You can use this feature only if you haven’t moved during this turn, and after you use it, your Speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.

**Assassinate.** You are adept at getting the drop on a target, granting you the following benefits:
- **Initiative**. You have Advantage on Initiative rolls.
- **Surprising Strikes**. During the first round of each combat, you have Advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn’t taken a turn. If your Sneak Attack hits any target during that round, the target takes extra damage of the weapon’s type equal to your Rogue level.
