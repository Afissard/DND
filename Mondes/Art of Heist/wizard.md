## Capacities 
**Darkvision**. Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**Gnome Cunning**. ;You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic.

**Ritual Adept.** You can cast any spell as a Ritual if that spell has the Ritual tag and the spell is in your spellbook. You needn’t have the spell prepared, but you must read from the book to cast a spell in this way.

**Arcane Recovery.** You can regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. When you finish a Short Rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level equal to no more than half your Wizard level (round up), and none of the slots can be level 6 or higher. For example, if you’re a level 4 Wizard, you can recover up to two levels' worth of spell slots, regaining either one level 2 spell slot or two level 1 spell slots.
Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

**Hypnotic Gaze.** Starting at 2nd level, your soothing words and mesmerizing gaze can captivate your audience. As an action, you choose one creature you can see within 5 feet of you. If the target can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or you charm it until the end of your next turn. The charmed creature’s speed is reduced to 0, it is incapacitated, and visibly dazed. On each subsequent turn, you can use your action to maintain this effect, extending its duration until the end of your next turn. However, this effect ends if you move more than 5 feet away from the creature, if it can no longer see or hear you, or if it takes damage. Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its initial saving throw against this effect, you can't use this feature against that creature again until you finish a long rest.
